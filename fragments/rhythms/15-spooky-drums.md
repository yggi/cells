A heartbeat, a clock and a knock: the beat of [Spooky, in pieces](../../examples/spooky.md).
The kick is a heartbeat on every beat, its second stroke a sixteenth after the first and softer (lub-dub); the ride ticks each beat, faint, a clock; the rim knocks once, at the middle of the bar, where the heart is between beats in a bar of an odd number of them.
Every line fits any meter and lands on its sixteenths: the kick and the ride cycle on a beat (`step=16n` four long, `step=4n` one long), and the rim halves the bar (`step=1m [~ &rim]`), and half of every bar the library's meters make is a whole number of sixteenths (6 in 3/4, 10 in 5/4, 7 in 7/8), so in 5/4 the heart beats five times and the knock falls between the third beat's strokes.
A Euclid spread over the bar (`step=1m &rim(3,8)`, v0.12.0's) put the knocks between the sixteenths of any bar but 4/4's and 12/8's, where a reader on the bar's sixteenths, as Jambot's drummer is, can't play them; a line on eighths (`step=8n`) lands on them but laps a bar of 4/4, which the fit refuses under the other meters.
Its lines are named by Jambot's drum roles (`kick`, `hat`, `euclid`) and strike only voices its kit holds (`&bd` 36, `&rd` 51, `&rim` 37), so the drummer plays it as it is; they strike the kit's names, holes the General MIDI kit fills, and carry no card (#291): `&groove` is the mix.
Written by hand for the point proposed for a Spooky preset (sync .2, harm .9, artic .3, energy .35; #349), weight 1: no preset of Jambot's sits there yet, and the axes are Jambot's (decision 041), so the point is this file's, Jambot's to adopt.
