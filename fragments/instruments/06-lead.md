The voice Jambot's lead plays through: `&leadV`, whose `loop=C4` sets the register, where Jambot's section text sounds its lead (`PIN_VOICES.lead`, E35's C4: yggi/jambot `packages/score/src/section-text.ts` @ 24a528b), so a lead played on it sends the MIDI notes it sends today, with no move on its gate.
Its sound is Jambot's lead (`timbreOf`, yggi/jambot `packages/engine/src/sound.ts` @ 227aa74): a soft triangle where the style is paddy blending to a bright square where it is stabby (`s=tri..square * &style[bite]`, decision 066), through a low-pass that opens with the section's bite (energy until decision 076; a reading of intensity may take it, #571), from 1400 Hz to 3600 Hz (`lpf=1400..3600 * &style[bite]`), its attack sharpening from 40 ms to 6 ms as bite rises (#391, #411). Jambot weights its triangle 1.8 against the square; the blend holds each wave at its own peak.
It reads the section's style, `&style`, the composer's, and declares it (decision 075, #560): `&leadV from (&style)`, its default the centre of style space (a blend halfway, 2500 Hz, 23 ms). A performer passes its own (`&leadV from lead(style=&style)`).
It sounds within the renderer's first stage (decision 062, R1), and changes no note MIDI out sends.
Its register is its own (decision 058): a performer that plays it higher or lower says so on its gate (`play=&part^$12`).

Associated as `bass` is, as the facet `instrument` at a quarter of the kit's weight; a performer asks for it by its id.

**Where it is found** (#540): on the points of Synth-pop, Deep house, Lo-fi hip hop and Bossa nova, where the centre point it had found it first, and of Techno, Ambient and Funk, a synth lead's styles; weight 0.25.
