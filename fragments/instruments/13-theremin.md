```

Spooky's lead, the theremin of a hundred horror films: a pure sine, fading in and out as a hand nears and leaves the antenna, with a wide vibrato of a quarter of a semitone five times a second.
It defines `&leadV`, the voice the lead performer plays (`use &leadV from lead`), so it fills the same hole as the default `lead`.
It is [Spooky, in pieces](../../examples/spooky.md)'s `&leadV` word for word, at the default's register (`loop=C4`), so a line played on it sends the MIDI notes it sends on `lead`.
It sounds within the renderer's first stage (decision 062, R1).

Associated at Spooky's point (`SPOOKY`: sync .2, harm .9, artic .3, energy .35; yggi/jambot#517) as the facet `instrument`, at half the default instruments' weight (0.125), so a query for an instrument finds it first at that point, and the kit and the defaults first at each of the eight presets (#350).
