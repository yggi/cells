---

Swing is the meter's: `swing=8n:2/3` leans one level of it, the eighths, and every line that taps the meter plays through it.
Of each pair of eighths the second starts a share of the way through their beat: 1/2 is straight, 2/3 the triplet swing, 3/4 hard.
The beats never move, nor the bar line: only the second eighth of each beat does.
The share here is a slider, 2/3 to start: in the Groove MIDI Dataset (#19, [the measurements](../docs/notes/groove-measure.md)), the jazz drummers who swing their eighths do so at .59 to .71, a median of .65, mostly a little short of the triplet.

## The band

The drums are the library's, Jambot's Swing jazz bar (`swing_jazz_drums`): the ride's ding, ding-a ding, ding-a, the pedal hat on two and four, a kick on one, the snare on four with a little fill.
The bass is the library's walking bass (`walking_bass`), a note on every beat, over a ii–V–I in F: G minor, C seventh, two bars of F, each chord with its seventh.
Both tap the meter, so both swing; neither writes a swing of its own.

## What leans, and what doesn't

The piano comps on the swung eighths: a shell of the chord, its third and its seventh, on the and of two and on four.
The head is in quarters, a pair of eighths in a beat as `[a b]` and a triplet as `[a b c]`: the pair leans, the triplet stays in its beat, even, since a triplet divides the beat and not the eighth.

```cells
&comp over=&harm step=8n ~ ~ ~ [1,3] ~ ~ [1,3] ~
&head over=&key step=4n ~ [1 3] 5 [4 3] [2 3] 4 [6 4 3] 1 2@2 ~ [0 2] 4 [3 2 1] 0@2

```

Swing a level finer and it is funk's: [Funk: the sixteenths lean](funk.md) leans the sixteenths, lightly, and leaves the eighths straight.
